				<h3 class="hero-intro">Pitch For Good provides a platform for highly-skilled professionals to pitch specialized, project-based volunteer ideas to nonprofits.</h3>

				<h4 class="hero-description">Passionate and skilled volunteers want to contribute to real change. Pitch for Good addresses a need in the community service space for volunteers to drive the creation of meaningful projects for causes they care about. Pitch for Good allows volunteers to pitch specific and time-bound projects directly to their nonprofits of choice. Organizations are notified when a project is pitched, and volunteers are notified when projects are accepted. In addition, nonprofits can search for volunteers with specialized skills. Pitch for Good provides a new paradigm for community service in your community.</h4>
